## 2024-05-24 - React Flow Unnecessary Re-renders
**Learning:** In React Flow, state arrays like `nodes` and `edges` trigger O(N) full re-renders on every tick during rapid animations (like Ghost Runner) if object references change, even when visual properties haven't.
**Action:** When mapping over `nodes` or `edges` state to update classes/styles, preserve the exact object references for items whose properties haven't changed.

## 2024-06-12 - React.memo() Anti-Pattern on Simulation Tick Prop
**Learning:** Applying `React.memo()` to a component that receives a prop which changes on every single render cycle (like `stepCount` on simulation ticks) is an anti-pattern. It degrades performance slightly by forcing a useless shallow comparison before rendering.
**Action:** Do not use `React.memo()` on components that depend on fast-changing props unless all other props are stable and you are memoizing specific slow children inside.

## 2024-06-12 - O(N*M) File System Checks during AST Analysis
**Learning:** Repeatedly calling `os.path.isfile()` to check if a module is local inside `ast.walk` creates an O(N*M) bottleneck, where N is the number of files and M is the number of imports per file.
**Action:** Pre-compute a `frozenset` of all local python modules using a single directory scan (`os.walk`), and perform O(1) set membership lookups instead of hitting the filesystem for each import.
## 2024-06-15 - Redundant O(N) Syscalls in ZIP Extraction
**Learning:** Calling `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` repeatedly for files belonging to the same directory during ZIP extraction creates a massive O(N) system call bottleneck, slowing down large archives.
**Action:** Always cache created directory paths in a `set()` to bypass the `os.makedirs` function entirely if the directory was already created in the current extraction loop.
